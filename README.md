# Sentiment Analysis Web Application

This repository contains a web application for sentiment analysis, developed using Flask, HTML, and JavaScript. The sentiment analysis is powered by various machine learning algorithms including XGBoost, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

## Features

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze sentiment of text input using different machine learning models.
- **Model Support**: XGBoost, SVM, Naive Bayes, and KNN.
- **User Interface**: Simple and intuitive web interface created with HTML and JavaScript.
- **Local Development**: Run the application locally for testing and development.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: Python web framework for creating the web application.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For the front-end of the web application.
- **XGBoost**: Gradient boosting algorithm for high-performance classification.
- **SVM (Support Vector Machine)**: For classification tasks.
- **Naive Bayes**: Probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Instance-based learning for classification.
